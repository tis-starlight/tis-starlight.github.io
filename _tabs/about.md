## ðŸ‘‹ Hi!

I'm a passionate **game developer** and **digital artist** with a solid academic background in **Computer Science**. Currently, I am pursuing my **MS** in **Computer Science** as a *graduate student* at **National Textile University ([NTU](https://www.ntu.edu.pk/index.php){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"}), Faisalabad, Pakistan**, where my journey is focused on *research* in the field, with a commitment to advancing the **Sustainable Development Goals ([SDGs](https://ntu.edu.pk/sustainability/){: target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"})** to serve humanity and contribute to a sustainable future.

Here, you'll find a wealth of unified resources covering a wide range of topics, all curated to streamline referencing, support academic growth and enhance your learning experience.

Below is a list of languages, tools & technologies that I'm familiar with. You can explore various tabs in the sidebar for quick navigation. The [categories](/categories) tab contains properly categorized content, while the [archives](/archives) tab provides a timeline of when each post was written. In the top right corner, you'll find a search bar to help you quickly find specific content. Additionally, you can toggle between light and dark mode to suit your preferences.

<div class="title"> The Story Behind the Screen </div>
<p> Over time, my notes and ideas scattered across various mediumsâ€”note books, loose pages, books, Obsidian vaults, text documents, PDFs, presentations, and even Google Memo app. As someone juggling multiple projects, I found myself repeatedly going back to relearn concepts, often piecing together information from countless sources just to regain what I had previously understood. It became a frustrating cycle, wasting time and energy. </p>
<p> I created this site to break that cycle. Itâ€™s my way of consolidating all those scattered notes into one unified, detailed resource thatâ€™s easy to reference. By sharing my experiences and learnings here, I hope to save others from the same frustration and provide a clear, concise guide through the topics Iâ€™ve explored. </p>
<p> Beyond just a learning hub, this website also doubles as my portfolio and blog, showcasing the projects Iâ€™m passionate about and the insights Iâ€™ve gained along the way. </p>
