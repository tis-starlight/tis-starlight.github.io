## CIA Triad

![cia-triad](https://i.imgur.com/oHZP4El.jpeg){: width="200" height="200" .right lqip="data:image/jpeg;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAgAAAAIAQMAAAD+wSzIAAAAA1BMVEWEhIIdHzHFAAAAC0lEQVQI12NgQAUAABAAAaHFIcEAAAAASUVORK5CYII=" .shadow style="border-radius: 10px;"}

The CIA triad is a fundamental model in information security that describes the three key principles of security: Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. Each principle plays a vital role in protecting information and ensuring the security of systems and data.

### C: Confidentiality

> **Confidentiality** ensures that sensitive information is accessible only to authorized individuals and protected from unauthorized access or disclosure. This principle is vital for maintaining privacy. 
{: .box-tip}

For instance, if I have a password for my Gmail account and someone sees it while Iâ€™m logging in, then my password has been compromised, resulting in a breach of confidentiality.
  - **Encryption**: Sensitive data, such as credit card numbers or personal health information, is encrypted during transmission and storage to prevent unauthorized access. For example, during an online purchase, credit card information is typically encrypted to ensure that only the payment processor can read it.
  - **Access Controls**: Organizations implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict access to sensitive information. For instance, only HR personnel may have access to employee salary information, while other employees do not.

### I: Integrity

> **Integrity** ensures the accuracy and consistency of data throughout its lifecycle. It protects data from unauthorized alterations, ensuring that information remains reliable and trustworthy.  
{: .box-tip}

For example, when an employee leaves an organization, the data related to that employee across all departments, such as accounts, should be updated to reflect the status as "JOB LEFT" to ensure that the data remains complete and accurate. Additionally, only authorized personnel should have the permission to edit employee data.
  - **Hashing**: Data integrity can be verified using hashing algorithms. For example, when a file is downloaded, a hash value can be provided. Users can compute the hash of the downloaded file and compare it with the original hash to verify that it hasnâ€™t been altered.
  - **Version Control**: In software development, version control systems (e.g., Git) track changes to code, allowing developers to maintain the integrity of the software and revert to previous versions if unauthorized changes occur.

### A: Availability

> **Availability** ensures that information and resources are accessible to authorized users when needed, focusing on minimizing downtime and maintaining system reliability. Denial of service attack is one of the factor that can hamper the availability of information.
{: .box-tip}

- **Redundancy**: Organizations often use redundant systems, such as backup servers or data replication, to ensure availability. For instance, a web application may have multiple servers that distribute the load, ensuring that if one server fails, others can take over without downtime.
- **Disaster Recovery Plans**: Having a disaster recovery plan ensures that systems can be quickly restored after outages, whether caused by hardware failure, natural disasters, or cyberattacks. For example, a company might implement a cloud-based backup solution to recover critical data and applications in case of a disaster.

### Additional Principles

In addition to the classic CIA triad of security goals, some organizations might also consider incorporating goals such as non-repudiation, authenticity, accountability, and reliability.

- **Non-Repudiation**: Non-repudiation ensures that one party cannot deny receiving a message or transaction, nor can the other party deny sending it. For example, in cryptography, if a message matches a digital signature signed with the senderâ€™s private key, it confirms that the sender sent the message, and no one else could have altered it during transmission. Data integrity and authenticity are prerequisites for non-repudiation.
- **Authenticity**: Authenticity involves verifying that users are who they claim to be and that inputs arriving at their destination come from trusted sources. Following this principle guarantees that a valid and genuine message is received from a trusted source through secure transmission.
- **Accountability**: Accountability ensures that actions taken by entities can be traced uniquely to them. For example, in the context of integrity, not all employees should have the authority to change other employees' data. Therefore, organizations often have specific departments responsible for making such changes, and any requests for data modifications must be authorized by a higher authority.
- **Reliability**: Reliability refers to the ability of a system, product, or service to perform its intended function consistently and accurately over time, without failure. In the context of information technology, it means that software, hardware, or network components can operate under specified conditions and deliver the expected results without unexpected interruptions or errors.
